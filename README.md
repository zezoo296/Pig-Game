Game Rules:
  Start the Game:
    Upon loading the game, a new game starts automatically with the first player.
    
  Rolling the Dice:
    On each turn, the player can choose to either roll the dice or hold their score.
    Rolling the dice generates a random number between 1 and 6.
    If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all points accumulated during that turn.
    
  Holding the Score:
    If the player holds, the accumulated points for that turn are added to their total score.
    The turn then passes to the other player.
    Winning the Game:
  
  The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
  When a player wins, a message is displayed with the winner's name and the option to restart the game.
  Restarting the Game:
    After a win or at any time, the game can be reset by clicking the "New Game" button, which resets all scores and starts a fresh game.
    Features:
    Interactive Gameplay: Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll and the "Hold" button to end your turn.
    Responsive Design: The game is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
    Score Tracking: Displays both the playerâ€™s current score and the accumulated points for each turn.
    Game Reset: Easily restart the game at any time with the "New Game" button.
